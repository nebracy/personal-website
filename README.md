# Flask Personal Website
This was the first interation of my personal website.

It was built using HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Flask as the web framework. I used it to start learning about web development, DevOps, and AWS services like EC2 and ECS.

You can check out the repo of my current personal website [here](https://github.com/nebracy/django-portfolio-website), it uses Django as the web framework instead.
