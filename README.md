# My Website
Welcome to my soon-to-be portfolio and personal website!

This website will eventually showcase some of my finished and ongoing Python projects.
For now, it is a little basic. Built using just HTML, CSS and some Javascript, it uses Flask as the web framework while inside a docker container hosted on AWS.
