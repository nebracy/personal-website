# My Website
Welcome to my personal website and soon-to-be portfolio!

This website will eventually showcase some of my finished and ongoing Python projects.
For now, it is a little basic, built using just HTML, CSS and a little Javascript. It uses Flask as the web framework inside a docker container, which is hosted on AWS ECS instance.
