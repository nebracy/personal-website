# My Website
Welcome, this is the old Flask version of my personal website. Currently, I am learning Django.

This was the initial version of my website that I used to start learning about web development and host some simple Python projects.
It is basic, using just HTML/CSS and some Javascript. Flask is the web framework. I am using docker containers and for now, this version it is still hosted on AWS.
